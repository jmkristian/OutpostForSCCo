<p>This program handles forms used for emergency communication by ARES and RACES
  in the San Francisco Bay area in California.
  It uses a web browser to display and edit forms.
  Data from a form can be transmitted in a text message,
  which a recipient can convert back to the same form.</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>Run the <code>browse.sh</code> script in this directory.
  It will open a page in your browser, with buttons you can use to either
  open a form and then create a message,
  or view a received message as a form.
  You can copy and paste messages to or from a BBS session or an email.
  </p>
<p>When filling out a form, required fields are outlined in red.
  The red disappears when you enter a value in the correct format.
  Hovering your cursor over a field may tell you about the required format.
  Some fields have values like <code>{{date}}</code> or <code>{{time}}</code>,
  which will be filled in automatically when you create a text message.</p>

<p>When all required fields are filled in, the header bar will change color
  and these buttons in the header will be enabled:
  <ul>
    <li>Create Message: convert the form to a text message, which you can copy-n-paste.</li>
    <li>Submit via Email: create an email message, and fill it out with a text message you can send.
      For best results, send the message in plain text format (not HTML or rich text).
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>

<p>To give someone a copy of a form, you can print it or save it as a PDF file.
  To create a PDF file, press Control+P and then choose 'Save as PDF' instead of a printer.
