<p>This program augments
  <a href="https://www.outpostpm.org">Outpost Packet Message Manager</a>,
  adding forms that are used for emergency communication by ARES and RACES
  in Santa Clara County, California.
  It uses a web browser to display and edit forms.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>Install Outpost before installing this program.
  Then, download a Setup.exe file from the
  <a href="https://github.com/jmkristian/OutpostForSCCo/releases">releases page</a>
  and run it. After installation is complete, exit and restart Outpost.</p>
<p>Antivirus or firewall products may resist installation.
  Here's how to overcome their resistance:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Windows Smart Screen may prevent an "unrecognized app" from starting.
      Click "More Info" and then "Run Anyway."</p></li>
  <li><p>Windows Firewall may ask to allow {{addon_name}}_Forms.exe to communicate on a network.
      Check the box for "Private networks" and click "Allow access."</p></li>
  <li><p>Norton Security may quarantine the installer. Open the Norton Security program,
      click "Security", click "History", select "Show Quarantine" and restore the installer.
      When creating or opening a message, Norton may pop up a message,
      "Suspicious network activity has been detected."
      Select "Allow this instance", check "Do not notify me again" and click "OK".</p></li>
  <li><p>Avast antivirus might say "This file might be dangerous - It's been submitted for interrogation."
      Click "More details" and then "I trust this file."
      Next, open Avast settings, select the "General" tab,
      check "allow me to decide" under "Enable CyberCapture"
      and try again to run the installer.
      Then you'll have to wait for a few minutes, until its interrogation is complete.
      Or Avast might say "this file may contain something bad,"
      or "CyberCapture has been activated. You've discovered a very rare file."
      After a minute, it might simply say "no problems found" and continue, without your intervention.
      Or it might show a link you can click to run the program anyway.</p></li>
  <li><p>Comodo Firewall may ask whether to allow the program to do things.
      For the {{addon_name}}Forms_Setup.exe installer program, click "Treat as Installer or Updater."
      For the bin\{{addon_name}}_Forms.exe program, check "Remember my answer" and click "Allow."</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Uninstall as you would any program.
  For example on Windows 8, open the control panel "Programs and Features",
  select "{{addon_name}} Forms" and click "Uninstall".
  If you don't see the program in the control panel, try closing and re-opening the control panel.
  If that fails, try running the program uninstall.exe in the folder where the program is installed.
  After uninstallation is complete, exit and restart Outpost.</p>
<p>For a silent install, run the installer with option <code>/S</code>.
  To specify an installation folder, add the option <code>/D=C:\YourFolder</code>.
  The <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Which_command_line_parameters_can_be_used_to_configure_installers">/D= option</a>
  must be last, and the folder name must not be surrounded by quotes.
  Beware: a folder name that contains whitepsace won't work with Outpost version 3.2 c118.
  For a silent uninstall, run <code>.\uninstall.exe /S</code> in the folder where the program is installed.</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>To create a new message, click an item in the 'Forms' menu of Outpost.
  A browser page will pop up; enter data and click the 'Submit to Outpost' button at the top.
  The text form of the message will pop up; enter the 'To' addresses and click 'Send' or 'Save'.</p>
<p>Opening a message that's not ready to send will pop up the text form, only,
  where you can enter the 'To' addresses.
  Opening a message that's ready to send will pop up a browser page.
  Opening a message that's been sent or received will ask whether you want to view the
  'original format'; that is a browser page.</p>
<h3 id="whenoutpostfails">When Outpost Fails</h3>
<p>If Outpost is unusable, it's still possible to use this program.
  Run browse.cmd in the folder where the program is installed.
  It should open a page in your browser, with buttons you can use to either
  open a form to create a message (which you could send via email),
  or view a received message as a form.</p>
<h3 id="incaseoftrouble">In Case of Trouble</h3>
<p>If something's not right, please report it by creating or updating an issue in the
  <a href="https://github.com/jmkristian/OutpostForSCCo/issues">issues page</a>.
  Please say what browser and what versions of this program, Outpost and Windows you used.
  To help isolate the problem, please attach all the files from the <code>logs</code> sub-folder
  of the folder where the program is installed,
  and a screenshot of a browser page (if any).</p>
<p>Power users might learn more by editing addons\*.ini, changing
  each occurrence of XXX\wscript.exe YYY\launch.vbs
  to YYY\launch-v.cmd and observing the console windows that pop up.
  The source code for bin\{{addon_name}}_Forms.exe is bin\Outpost_Forms.js.</p>
