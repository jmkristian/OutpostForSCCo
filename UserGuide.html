<p>This program augments
  <a href="https://www.outpostpm.org">Outpost Packet Message Manager</a>,
  adding forms that are used for emergency communication by ARES and RACES
  in Santa Clara County, California.
  It uses a web browser to display and edit forms.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>Install Outpost before installing this program.
  Then, download a Setup.exe file from the
  <a href="https://github.com/jmkristian/OutpostForSCCo/releases">releases page</a>
  and run it. After installation is complete, exit and restart Outpost.</p>
<p>Antivirus or firewall products may resist installation.
  Here's how to overcome their resistance:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Windows Smart Screen may prevent an "unrecognized app" from starting.
      Click "More Info" and then "Run Anyway."</p></li>
  <li><p>Windows Firewall may ask to allow {{PROGRAM_PATH}} to communicate on a network.
      Check the box for "Private networks" and click "Allow access", or click "Cancel".</p></li>
  <li><p>Norton Security may quarantine the installer. Open the Norton Security program,
      click "Security", click "History", select "Show Quarantine" and restore the installer.
      When creating or opening a message, Norton may pop up a message,
      "Suspicious network activity has been detected."
      Select "Allow this instance", check "Do not notify me again" and click "OK".</p></li>
  <li><p>Avast antivirus might say "This file might be dangerous - It's been submitted for interrogation."
      Click "More details" and then "I trust this file."
      Next, open Avast settings, select the "General" tab,
      check "allow me to decide" under "Enable CyberCapture"
      and try again to run the installer.
      Then you'll have to wait for a few minutes, until its interrogation is complete.
      Or Avast might say "this file may contain something bad,"
      or "CyberCapture has been activated. You've discovered a very rare file."
      After a minute, it might simply say "no problems found" and continue, without your intervention.
      Or it might show a link you can click to run the program anyway.</p></li>
  <li><p>Comodo Firewall may ask whether to allow the program to do things.
      For the installer Setup.exe, click "Treat as Installer or Updater."
      For the program {{PROGRAM_PATH}}, check "Remember my answer" and click "Allow."</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Uninstall as you would any program.
  For example on Windows 8, open the control panel "Programs and Features",
  select "{{DisplayName}}" and click "Uninstall".
  If you don't see the program in the control panel, try closing and re-opening the control panel.
  If that fails, try running the program {{INSTDIR}}\uninstall.exe.
  After uninstallation is complete, exit and restart Outpost.</p>
<p>For a silent install, run the installer with option <code>/S</code>.
  To specify an installation folder, add the option <code>/D=C:\YourFolder</code>.
  The <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Which_command_line_parameters_can_be_used_to_configure_installers">/D= option</a>
  must be last, and the folder name must not be surrounded by quotes.
  Beware: a folder name that contains whitepsace won't work with Outpost version 3.2 c118.
  For a silent uninstall, run <code>.\uninstall.exe /S</code> in the folder where the program is installed.</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>To create a new message, click an item in the 'Forms' menu of Outpost.
  A browser page will pop up, with fields where you enter data.
  Fields outlined in red require your input, sometimes in a specific format.
  The red outline will disappear when you enter data in the right format.
  Once you've filled in all the data, click the 'Submit to Outpost' button at the top.
  If all goes well, the browser page will say the message was submitted to Outpost,
  and the plain text message will pop up in another window.
  Fill in the 'To' address and click 'Send' or 'Save'.
  The message will go into Outpost's Out Tray if you click 'Send', or into Draft Msgs if you click 'Save'.
  After submitting the message to Outpost, you can close the form in your browser.</p>
<p>To edit a message before you send it, select it in an Outpost folder and click 'Open' or press the Enter key.
  A browser page will pop up. Edit the data, click 'Submit to Outpost' and click 'Send' or 'Save'.
  Outpost won't send the message to the BBS until after you click 'Send' in the text message window.
  (That's because the message is marked as a 'Draft' when you start editing it.)</p>
<p>Opening a message that's already been sent, or received from another station,
  will pop up a read-only view of the form in your browser.
  If you want to see the plain text message, select the message in an Outpost folder and click
  'Open enhanced msg as text' in the Outpost 'Actions' menu.</p>
<p>To give someone a copy of a form, you can print it or save it as a PDF file.
  To create a PDF file, press Control+P and then choose a PDF writer instead of a printer.
  In Google Chrome, you can choose 'Save as PDF'.
  On Windows 10, you can choose 'Microsoft Print to PDF'.
  On older versions of Windows, you can add a PDF writer to your print dialog by installing
  <a href="http://www.cutepdf.com/Products/CutePDF/writer.asp">Cute PDF</a> or
  <a href="https://www.bullzip.com/products/pdf/info.php">Bullzip</a>.
  </p>
<h3 id="whenoutpostisunavailable">When Outpost is Unavailable</h3>
<p>You can use forms even if you can't use Outpost,
  for example if Outpost hasn't been installed and you can't install it.
  Run {{INSTDIR}}\manual.cmd.
  It will open a page in your browser, with buttons you can use to either
  open a form to create a message (which you can copy and paste into a BBS session),
  or view a received message as a form.</p>
<h3 id="incaseoftrouble">In Case of Trouble</h3>
<p>If something's not right, please report it by posting to the
  <a href="https://www.scc-ares-races.org/data/packet/packet-technical-support.html#user">packet discussion group</a>.
  Please say what versions of browser, Outpost and Windows you used.
  To help isolate the problem, please attach the <code>version.txt</code> file from {{INSTDIR}},
  all the files from the <code>logs</code> sub-folder,
  and a screenshot of a browser page (if any).</p>
<p>Power users might learn more by editing addons\*.ini, changing
  each occurrence of XXX\wscript.exe YYY\launch.js
  to YYY\launch-v.cmd and observing the console windows that pop up.
  The source code for {{PROGRAM_PATH}} is bin\Outpost_Forms.js.</p>
